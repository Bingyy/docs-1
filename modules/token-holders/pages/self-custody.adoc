If you recently received notification of your token distribution options and have decided to take ownership and manage the tokens available to you on your own, you can follow the instructions in this guide to authenticate your distribution and take custody of your tokens.

If you aren't sure if self-custody is right for you, be sure to review the information in the link:xxx[Frequently-asked questions] before you continue down this path.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

This _Self-Custody Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are a new token holders and are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time on a local computer.

To get start, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.

* You have all of the personal documentsâ€”such your passport and driver's license available.
These documents are required to validate your identity as part of the Know Your Customer (KYC) process.

* You know how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer and how to run basic command-line programsin the terminal.

If you need help meeting any of these prerequisites, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without additional instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.
